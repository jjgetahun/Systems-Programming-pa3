Input: int x = 2;
       free(&x);
Expected output: "Address passed was not returned from malloc() or has already been freed. Error caused by line ___ in ___.c."

Input: int* y = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(y);
       free(y);
Expected output: "Address passed was not returned from malloc() or has already been freed. Error caused by line ___ in ___.c."

Input: char* p = (char *) malloc(200);
       free(p+10);
Expected output: "Address passed was not returned from malloc() or has already been freed. Error caused by line ___ in ___.c."

Input: char* p = (char *) malloc(100);
       free(p);
       char* p = (char *) malloc(100);
       free(p);
Expected output: This is a valid input, so no error message is outputted.

Input: int* z = (int *) malloc(sizeof(0));
       free(z);
Expected output: This is a valid input, so no error message is outputted.

Input: int i = 0;
       for (; i < 5000; i++) {
           char* y = (char *) malloc(0);
           if (y == 0)
               break;
       }
Expected output: "No available space. Error caused by line ___ in ___.c."
